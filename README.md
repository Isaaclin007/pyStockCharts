#Design  

An app broken out in to a data fetching back-end, analytics functions, charting functions, queries to manipulate large querysets, a folder with a huge C library to migrate to pure python, django ORM models for various things, and user interface classes for the pygi app in progress...  
  
It's quite an undertaking.  
  
#Notes
Not ready for production at all. Doesn't even do anything beyond the initial sync right now...  It's basically a sketch of where I hope it goes.  

Really just progress in the github stash.
